# Laravel Blade with FluxUI Rules

## FluxUI Component Usage

- Use `<flux:` components for all UI elements rather than raw HTML.
- Use heroicons without the `heroicon-` prefix (e.g., `icon="check"` not `icon="heroicon-check"`).
- Never use `variant="secondary"` on any FluxUI components, use appropriate alternatives.
- Never use `size` attributes on any FluxUI components - use Tailwind classes for sizing instead.
- For spacing and layout, use Tailwind classes rather than custom CSS.
- Use `wire:model` for data binding with Livewire components.
- Use `wire:click` for event handling with Livewire components.

## Blade Template Structure

- Always include `@fluxAppearance` in the `<head>` section of your layout.
- Always include `@fluxScripts` before the closing `</body>` tag.
- Use `@csrf` in all forms for security.
- Use `@method` for non-GET/POST form methods.
- Use `@livewire` to include Livewire components.

## FluxUI Component Specific Rules

- For forms, always wrap form elements in a `<flux:field>` component for consistent styling.
- For buttons, prefer `variant="primary"` for main actions and `variant="ghost"` for secondary actions.
- For modals, always use the `name` attribute to enable proper triggering.
- For notifications, use `<flux:toast>` components rather than JavaScript alerts.
- For icons, use the direct icon name (e.g., `icon="check"`) without any prefix.
- For data tables, use `<flux:table>` components with proper `<flux:table.head>` and `<flux:table.body>` structure.

## Livewire Integration

- Use `wire:model` for two-way data binding.
- Use `wire:click` for event handling.
- Prefer `wire:model.live` for real-time updates when appropriate.
- Use `$wire` in Alpine.js expressions to access Livewire component methods.

## Modal Handling

- Use named modals with `<flux:modal name="modal-name">`.
- Trigger modals with `<flux:modal.trigger name="modal-name">`.
- Close modals with `<flux:modal.close>`.
- For programmatic control, use `$flux.modal('name').show()` and `$flux.modal('name').close()`.

## FluxUI Authentication 

- Use `<flux:brand>` for the app logo and branding.
- Use `<flux:navbar>` for navigation headers with proper structure.
- Use `<flux:profile>` for user profile displays.
- Use `@auth` and `@guest` directives for authentication-based content.

# Your rule content
- Use heroicons but without heroicon- prefix.
- Never use variant="secondary" on any <flux> components
- Never use size attributes on any <flux> components
- Never use size="lg" on any <flux> components
